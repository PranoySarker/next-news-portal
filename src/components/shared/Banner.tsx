            OpenAI Is Growing Fast and Burning Through Piles of Money
          </h2>
          <p>
            OpenAI, the San Francisco start-up behind ChatGPT, has been telling
            investors that it is making billions from its chatbot and that it
            expects to make a lot more in the coming years. But it has not been
            quite so clear about how much it is losing. OpenAIâ€™s monthly revenue
            hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of
            2023, and the company expects about $3.7 billion in annual sales
            this year, according to financial documents reviewed by The New York
            Times. OpenAI estimates that its revenue will balloon to $11.6
            billion next year.
